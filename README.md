# Discrete network model for the Puntos Verdes of Barcelona
 
Academic project. Part of the Msc in Statistics and Operational Research at UPC.

All the information is in Spanish.

## Summary

The project formulates the design of a network model for the "Puntos Verdes"  of Barcelona. The "Puntos Verdes", also known as "Puntos Limpios" in other localities of Spain, are public facilities created to collect all the waste for which there are no specific containers on the street. These infrastructures located in strategic points of the city help to recover materials that can not be classified as the majority of waste, such as paints, clothes electrical appliances,etc.

The work aims to find the optimum set of routes for a fleet of vehicles that collect and transport the waste from each "Punto Verdes" to a central deposit. The goal is to find the best service strategy using the least number of resources (less number of trucks and less distance traveled). 

The problem posed is a well-known problem called Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) which has been mathematically formulated and solved with python in a deterministic and heuristic way for the different strategies tested.
